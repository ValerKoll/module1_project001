# {{PROBLEM}} Function Design Recipe



## 1. Describe the Problem



## 2. Design the Function Signature


```python
def ():
    # Parameters:
    # Returns: (state the return value and its type)
    # Side effects: this function doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
    pass 
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

```python
"""

"""
func() ==>  return

```


## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._


List of testing files
    test_todo_list.py

>>> implement in testing files not here
----------------------------

```python
from  import *
# example
"""
Given a ....
"""
def test_extract_uppercase_with_upper_then_lower():
    result = extract_uppercase("hello WORLD")
    assert result == ["WORLD"]

```


EXAMPLE text:
"#TODO Fill the E30 form by tomorrow"
"I stayed out fifteen minutes, and then went back, hoping for better luck. #TODO Fill the E30 form by tomorrow. Of course all the chairs were occupied now, and four men sat waiting, silent, unsociable, distraught, and looking bored, as men always do who are waiting their turn in a barber's shop."
